Neural Network

### General Neural Network Beta version under work...
fc_m_resnet Constructor
Seed radomizer done
Fully connected residual neural network object
fc_m_resnet object version : 0.0.1
 Number of hidden layers is set to = 2
Size of hidden_layer[0][x] = 10
Size of hidden_layer[1][x] = 30
hidden_layer vector is now set up
Now setup all_weight, change_weights vectors size of this fc block
Size of temporary dummy_1D_weight_vector from input layer connection[0] is = 4
Size of temporary dummy_1D_weight_vector from hidden layer connection[1] is = 11
Size of temporary dummy_1D_weight_vector last hidden layer connection[1] is = 31
The size of all_weight and change_weights in now setup OK !
Note that the program how call this object could only set this size once. No protections against change size of the public vectors
Setup state = 2
Size of layer dimentions[] of weights at the this nn block = 3
Size of node dimentions[][] of weights for hidden layer number 0 is: 10
Size of weight dimentions[][][] of weights for hidden layer number 0 is: 4
Size of node dimentions[][] of weights for hidden layer number 1 is: 30
Size of weight dimentions[][][] of weights for hidden layer number 1 is: 11
Size of node dimentions[][] of weights for hidden layer number 2 is: 3
Size of weight dimentions[][][] of weights for hidden layer number 2 is: 31
Do you want to load weights from saved weight file = Y/N
