 this implementation, we first define a `transposeConvolution` function that takes in the input vector, kernel vector, and stride value as arguments and returns the output vector. The function iterates over each output channel, input channel, and output spatial position, and calculates the output value for that position using the kernel values and input values at the corresponding spatial positions. 

We then define the `main` function where we initialize the input and kernel vectors with arbitrary values, and perform transpose convolution with a stride of 2. Finally, we print the output values for each output channel.

Note that this implementation assumes that the input, output, and kernel vectors have square spatial dimensions, and that the dimensions of the input and kernel vectors match up appropriately for the transpose convolution operation. Also, this implementation assumes that the input and kernel vectors have the same spatial dimensions. If this is not the case, some additional handling would need to be added to account for this.
